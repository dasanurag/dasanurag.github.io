title: "Classification between story-telling and poem recitaiton using head gestures of the talker"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'In this work, we show that head gestures while reciting poems(rhythmic speech) have more periodic structure than while narrating stories.
We use a dataset of 10 subjects reciting 20 poems and a seperate set of 20 subjects, each narrating 5 stories. 
To show the periodicity of head gestures, we use a measure based on the autocorrelation of the input signal. Using the information of peaks in the autocorrelation of an input signal, we achieve a highest periodicity of 0.489 in case of poems and a highest periodicity of 0.347 in case of stories.
We further perform a classification task to classify between spontaneous speech and rhythmic speech. 
We show that head gesture features perform comparably well to the acoustic features(MFCCs), with accuracies 89% and 96% approximately. We further show that combination of head gestures and acoustic features outperform the acoustic features.'
