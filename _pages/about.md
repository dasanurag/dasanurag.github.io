Hi, I'm Anurag, currently a PhD student in Computer Engineering in Texas A&M University. Research interests are in
voice and accent conversion. I'm also interested in developing systems for automatic glucose monitoring by analyzing data from continuous glucose monitors.

Previously, I worked as a Project Assistant in [SPIRE Lab](http://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/) in the Electrical Engineering Department of [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](http://iisc.ac.in/), under the supervision of [Dr. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/prasantg/) on problems related to Automatic Speech Recognition and Keyword Spotting. 

I have also worked in [Idea Cellular Limited](http://www.ideacellular.com/), as a BSS Engineer. Some of my key roles included 
ensuring seamless performance of all 2G and 3G sites, installing new and upgrading existing microwave links between sites and ensuring all site related outages are dealt with at the earliest.

Apart from this, I'm also a chess enthusiast and frequent online platforms such as lichess and chess.com, for a game or two.
