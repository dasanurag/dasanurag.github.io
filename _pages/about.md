Hi, I'm Anurag, currently a PhD student in [PSI Lab](https://psi.engr.tamu.edu/) in the Department of Computer Engineering in [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Ricardo Gutierrez-Osuna](https://psi.engr.tamu.edu/people/ricardo-gutierrez-osuna/). My research interests are developing digital health solutions for monitoring diabetes using continuous glucose monitors. I'm also interested in research in speech processing such as speech recognition, speech synthesis applications such as voice and accent conversion.  

Previously, I worked as a Project Assistant in [SPIRE Lab](http://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/) in the Electrical Engineering Department of [Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](http://iisc.ac.in/), under the supervision of [Dr. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](http://www.ee.iisc.ac.in/people/faculty/prasantg/) on problems related to Automatic Speech Recognition and Keyword Spotting. 

I have also worked in [Idea Cellular Limited](http://www.ideacellular.com/), as a BSS Engineer. Some of my key roles included 
ensuring seamless performance of all 2G and 3G sites, installing new and upgrading existing microwave links between sites and ensuring all site related outages are dealt with at the earliest.

Apart from this, I'm also a chess enthusiast and frequent online platforms such as lichess and chess.com.
